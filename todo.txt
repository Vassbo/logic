- Add a gamemode (Like; MakeItTrue)
(Logic mode, electric mode, game mode)

- lined = squared ?

- ctrl + shift will not deselect anything before selecting with blue box

- move cursor on main drag

- save settings to local storage

- show red line when a two way input (e.g. and gate) does not have an input..

- svg line dragging on clock will not update line
- svg drop on clock will remove all signals from clock one time

- deleting a thing will leave black border

- replace clientX/Y with pageX/Y

- when selecting, and letting go on an element. Then trying to select is buggy...
